Replace port numbers with stable, named .localhost URLs. For humans and agents.

```diff
- "dev": "next dev"              # http://localhost:3000
+ "dev": "peakroute myapp next dev"  # http://myapp.localhost:1355
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install -g peakroute

# Start the proxy (once, no sudo needed)
peakroute proxy start

# Run your app (auto-starts the proxy if needed)
peakroute myapp next dev
# -> http://myapp.localhost:1355
```

> The proxy auto-starts when you run an app. You can also start it explicitly with `peakroute proxy start`.

## Why

Local dev with port numbers is fragile:

- **Port conflicts** -- two projects default to the same port and you get `EADDRINUSE`
- **Memorizing ports** -- was the API on 3001 or 8080?
- **Refreshing shows the wrong app** -- stop one server, start another on the same port, and your open tab now shows something completely different
- **Monorepo multiplier** -- every problem above scales with each service in the repo
- **Agents test the wrong port** -- AI coding agents guess or hardcode the wrong port, especially in monorepos
- **Cookie and storage clashes** -- cookies set on `localhost` bleed across apps on different ports; localStorage is lost when ports shift
- **Hardcoded ports in config** -- CORS allowlists, OAuth redirect URIs, and `.env` files all break when ports change
- **Sharing URLs with teammates** -- "what port is that on?" becomes a Slack question
- **Browser history is useless** -- your history for `localhost:3000` is a jumble of unrelated projects

Peakroute fixes all of this by giving each dev server a stable, named `.localhost` URL that both humans and agents can rely on.

## Usage

```bash
# Basic
peakroute myapp next dev
# -> http://myapp.localhost:1355

# Subdomains
peakroute api.myapp npm start
# -> http://api.myapp.localhost:1355

peakroute docs.myapp next dev
# -> http://docs.myapp.localhost:1355
```

### In package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "peakroute myapp next dev"
  }
}
```

The proxy auto-starts when you run an app. Or start it explicitly: `peakroute proxy start`.

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Browser["Browser<br/>myapp.localhost:1355"]
    Proxy["peakroute proxy<br/>(port 1355)"]
    App1[":4123<br/>myapp"]
    App2[":4567<br/>api"]

    Browser -->|port 1355| Proxy
    Proxy --> App1
    Proxy --> App2
```

1. **Start the proxy** -- auto-starts when you run an app, or start explicitly with `peakroute proxy start`
2. **Run apps** -- `peakroute <name> <command>` assigns a free port and registers with the proxy
3. **Access via URL** -- `http://<name>.localhost:1355` routes through the proxy to your app

Apps are assigned a random port (4000-4999) via the `PORT` and `HOST` environment variables. Most frameworks (Next.js, Express, Nuxt, etc.) respect these automatically. For frameworks that ignore `PORT` (Vite, Astro, React Router, Angular), peakroute auto-injects the correct `--port` and `--host` flags.

## HTTP/2 + HTTPS

Enable HTTP/2 for faster dev server page loads. Browsers limit HTTP/1.1 to 6 connections per host, which bottlenecks dev servers that serve many unbundled files (Vite, Nuxt, etc.). HTTP/2 multiplexes all requests over a single connection.

```bash
# Start with HTTPS/2 -- generates certs and trusts them automatically
peakroute proxy start --https

# First run prompts for sudo once to add the CA to your system trust store.
# After that, no prompts. No browser warnings.

# Make it permanent (add to .bashrc / .zshrc)
export PEAKROUTE_HTTPS=1
peakroute proxy start    # HTTPS by default now

# Use your own certs (e.g., from mkcert)
peakroute proxy start --cert ./cert.pem --key ./key.pem

# If you skipped sudo on first run, trust the CA later
sudo peakroute trust
```

## Commands

```bash
peakroute <name> <cmd> [args...]  # Run app at http://<name>.localhost:1355
peakroute list                    # Show active routes
peakroute trust                   # Add local CA to system trust store
peakroute alias <host> <port>    # Register external service (e.g., Docker)
peakroute alias remove <host>     # Remove an external route

# Disable peakroute (run command directly)
PEAKROUTE=0 bun dev              # Bypasses proxy, uses default port
# Also accepts PEAKROUTE=skip

# Proxy control
peakroute proxy start             # Start the proxy (port 1355, daemon)
peakroute proxy start --https     # Start with HTTP/2 + TLS
peakroute proxy start -p 80       # Start on port 80 (requires sudo)
peakroute proxy start --foreground  # Start in foreground (for debugging)
peakroute proxy stop              # Stop the proxy

# Options
-p, --port <number>              # Port for the proxy (default: 1355)
                                 # Ports < 1024 require sudo
--https                          # Enable HTTP/2 + TLS with auto-generated certs
--cert <path>                    # Use a custom TLS certificate (implies --https)
--key <path>                     # Use a custom TLS private key (implies --https)
--no-tls                         # Disable HTTPS (overrides PEAKROUTE_HTTPS)
--foreground                     # Run proxy in foreground instead of daemon
--force                          # Override a route registered by another process

# Environment variables
PEAKROUTE_PORT=<number>           # Override the default proxy port
PEAKROUTE_HTTPS=1                 # Always enable HTTPS
PEAKROUTE_STATE_DIR=<path>        # Override the state directory

# Info
peakroute --help                  # Show help
peakroute --version               # Show version
```

## State Directory

Peakroute stores its state (routes, PID file, port file) in a directory that depends on the proxy port:

- **Port < 1024** (sudo required): `/tmp/peakroute` -- shared between root and user processes
- **Port >= 1024** (no sudo): `~/.peakroute` -- user-scoped, no root involvement

Override with the `PEAKROUTE_STATE_DIR` environment variable if needed.

## External Services (Docker, etc.)

Use the `peakroute alias` command to register routes for services not spawned by peakroute, such as Docker containers or other external processes:

```bash
# Register a Docker container running on port 3000
peakroute alias mydocker.localhost 3000

# Now access it at http://mydocker.localhost:1355

# Remove the alias when done
peakroute alias remove mydocker.localhost
```

Aliases are marked with `[external]` in the route list and are never cleaned up as "stale" since they don't have an associated process PID.

```bash
peakroute list
# -> http://mydocker.localhost:1355 -> localhost:3000 (pid 0) [external]
```

## Git Worktree Support

Peakroute automatically detects when you're running inside a [Git Worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) and prepends the branch name as a subdomain prefix. This gives each worktree a unique URL without any configuration changes.

```bash
# In a worktree on branch feat/login
peakroute myapp next dev
# -> http://feat-login.myapp.localhost:1355

# In a worktree on branch fix/auth-bug
peakroute api next dev
# -> http://fix-auth-bug.api.localhost:1355
```

The branch name is sanitized for use as a hostname (slashes become hyphens, invalid characters are removed).

## Development

This repo is a Bun workspace monorepo using [Turborepo](https://turbo.build). The publishable package lives in `packages/peakroute/`.

```bash
bun install          # Install all dependencies
bun run build        # Build all packages
bun run test         # Run tests
bun run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage
bun run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
bun run lint         # Lint all packages
bun run typecheck    # Type-check all packages
bun run format       # Format all files with Prettier
```

## Proxying Between Peakroute Apps

If your frontend dev server (e.g. Vite, webpack) proxies API requests to another peakroute app, make sure the proxy rewrites the `Host` header. Without this, the proxy sends the **original** Host header, causing peakroute to route the request back to the frontend in an infinite loop.

**Vite** (`vite.config.ts`):

```ts
server: {
  proxy: {
    "/api": {
      target: "http://api.myapp.localhost:1355",
      changeOrigin: true,  // Required: rewrites Host header to match target
      ws: true,
    },
  },
}
```

**webpack-dev-server** (`webpack.config.js`):

```js
devServer: {
  proxy: [{
    context: ["/api"],
    target: "http://api.myapp.localhost:1355",
    changeOrigin: true,  // Required: rewrites Host header to match target
  }],
}
```

Peakroute detects this misconfiguration and responds with `508 Loop Detected` along with a message pointing to this fix.
